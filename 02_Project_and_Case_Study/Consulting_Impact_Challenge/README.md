# Walker Precision Engineering – The Consulting Impact Challenge (MB977)

**Module:** MB977 – The Consulting Impact Challenge  
**University:** University of Strathclyde Business School  
**Focus:** Strategic Consulting, Market Expansion, Digital Transformation, Organisational Design  
**Document:** Consulting_Impact_Challenge.pdf

## 📌 Project Overview

This consulting project involved working directly with **Walker Precision Engineering (WPE)**, a UK-based advanced manufacturing firm serving defence, aerospace, space systems, and emerging technologies.  
The challenge: WPE had reached a growth ceiling (~£20–25M revenue) and needed a clear, actionable roadmap to scale to **£50M revenue in five years** while modernising operations, reducing client concentration risk, and entering new sectors.

The final deliverable was a **board-level strategic report** with a comprehensive transformation plan built on market analysis, organisational diagnostics, PESTLE, VRIO, TOWS, and a full implementation roadmap.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

WPE is a technically strong engineering organisation but faces structural challenges:

- Heavy dependency on a small group of defence clients  
- Minimal business development (BD) capabilities  
- Weak digital presence and no marketing function  
- Undocumented internal processes  
- Limited risk governance  
- A reactive commercial approach rather than strategic pipeline building  
- Need to scale Poland operations and diversify sectors  

The company must evolve from engineering-led survival to a market-driven **Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS)** provider.

# 🧩 Key Analyses & Frameworks Used

### **1. PESTLE Analysis**
Mapped macro trends across World, Europe, UK:
- Defence spending surges (NATO, EU, UK)  
- Space sector growing >3× by 2035  
- Semiconductor localisation in Europe  
- Poland’s geopolitical and economic positioning  
- AI regulation and digital transformation  

### **2. Market Analysis**
Assessed WPE’s growth potential across:

- **Aerospace & Defence** – Core market, high growth, high expectations  
- **Space Systems** – High-complexity work, long-term partnerships  
- **Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment** – Adjacent, high potential, requires strict qualification  
- **Nuclear** – Very high compliance, slower ramp, future strategic space  
- **Quantum & Emerging Tech** – R&D-driven, long-term positioning  

### **3. VRIO Assessment**
Strengths:
- Certifications, heritage, multi-site footprint, high-spec capability  
Weaknesses:
- Sales capability, digital presence, documentation gaps  

### **4. TOWS Matrix**
Generated four action categories:
- SO strategies (sector expansion, digital differentiation)  
- WO strategies (hire BD, CRM, SOPs)  
- ST strategies (risk governance, diversified pipelines)  
- WT strategies (process discipline, succession planning)

# 🏗️ Recommended Strategy: Becoming a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) Provider

The MaaS model reframes WPE as a **strategic partner**, not just a precision machining vendor.  
WPE sells:  
➡ **Confidence, compliance, and time** — not just components.

Core pillars:

### **1. Create Sector-Focused Strategic Business Units (SBUs)**
- Defence & Aerospace  
- Space & Communications  
- Semiconductors & Nuclear  

Each with a dedicated Business Development Lead.

### **2. Establish Poland as the EU Operational HQ**
- Lower labour cost  
- Access to EU clients  
- Strategic location  
- Supports EU supply chain onshoring  

### **3. Build Digital Commercial Muscle**
- Website revamp  
- Integrated CRM  
- Sector-focused landing pages  
- Case studies and RFQ system  
- SEO + LinkedIn analytics  

### **4. Strengthen Internal Systems**
- SOPs for onboarding, quoting, production  
- Downtime tracking and job visibility  
- Documented cross-site workflows  
- Program Management Office
