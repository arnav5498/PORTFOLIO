## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a board-level strategic recommendation to embed **Decent and Fair Work (DFW)** within TransUnion India’s **Business System Evolution (BSE)** team.  
The proposal focuses on two high-impact Fair Work dimensions:

- **Opportunity** (career pathways)  
- **Respect** (hybrid leadership + strengths-based feedback)  

It includes organisational analysis, strategic options, expected outcomes, people and business value, stakeholder engagement, and a phased implementation plan.

The work combines **responsible management**, **evidence-based practice**, and **ESG Human Capital** expectations — making it a strong demonstration of leadership and people strategy capability.

## 🎯 Core Problem Statement

Despite strong agile culture and high collaboration, the BSE team faced persistent challenges:

- Delayed progression for junior–mid-level employees  
- Rigid evaluation KPIs and limited autonomy  
- Hybrid working friction and perceived disrespect  
- Lack of structured career visibility  
- Weaknesses in feedback design  

These issues directly impacted productivity, psychological safety, and wellbeing.

The strategic question:  
**How should TransUnion India invest in Opportunity and Respect without disrupting delivery?**

## 🧩 Options Considered

### **Option 1 — Maintain Current State**
- Short-term stability  
- But: rising disengagement, risk of attrition, weak EVP  
- Ignores DFW and ESG-Human Capital expectations  

### **Option 2 — Three-Part Fair Work Investment (Recommended)**
1. **Structured Career Pathways**  
   - Skill maps, transparent routes, development support  

2. **Strengths-Based Feedback Redesign**  
   - Evidence-led, employee-owned, more meaningful conversations  

3. **Respect-Based Hybrid Leadership**  
   - Trust-building, psychological safety, co-designed tools  

This option improves retention, capability, inclusion, and wellbeing, aligning with both organisational needs and global ESG norms.

- **Fair Work Framework (2016)** – Opportunity + Respect
