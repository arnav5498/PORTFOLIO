## 📌 Project Summary
ClearESG is a SaaS venture designed to help UK SMEs meet growing ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) requirements using simple, affordable and guided reporting tools. Developed as my MBA Capstone, the project combines market research, venture design, ESG frameworks and full business modelling to build an investor-ready business plan.

## 🎯 Problem
UK SMEs face increasing ESG expectations from:
- Banks and lenders  
- Large corporations in their supply chain  
- Customers and investors  
- Emerging regulations (TPT, ISSB, GRI)

But SMEs lack:
- ESG expertise  
- Time  
- Affordable guidance  
- Tools designed for them

**ClearESG solves this by giving SMEs a simple, structured way to produce ESG disclosures and transition plans.**
