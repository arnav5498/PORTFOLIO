- Strategic partnerships and acquisitions  

### **Why not Stage 4?**
- Recurring FDA quality violations  
- Customer-facing digital gaps  
- Overdependence on US generics market  
- Limited patient-centric innovation  

Sun Pharma supports business strategy well but does not yet **shape market competition** — the hallmark of Stage 4.
