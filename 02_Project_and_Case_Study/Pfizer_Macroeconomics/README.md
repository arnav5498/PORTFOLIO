## 📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates **Pfizer’s strategic environment in India** using two forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios projected five years ahead.  
Both scenarios begin with a common crisis: a **negative energy price shock**, especially disruptive for India due to its reliance on imported crude oil (85%+) and natural gas.

From that baseline, the scenarios diverge:

- **Scenario A:** Energy Crisis + *Accelerating Technological Change*  
- **Scenario B:** Energy Crisis + *Intensifying Climate Change*

The analysis integrates **AS–AD modelling**, **PESTEL**, and **Porter’s Five Forces** to examine how India's macroeconomic shifts affect Pfizer’s competitiveness, operating environment, and future strategy.

## ⚡ Crisis Justification: Energy Price Shock

India’s vulnerability to global energy volatility makes a sustained energy price shock a realistic and high-impact crisis.  
Consequences include:

- Stagflation (high inflation + low growth)  
- Rupee depreciation  
- Higher production and logistics costs  
- Tight monetary policy (higher interest rates)  
- Reduced household consumption  
- Decline in private investment  

Macroeconomically, this shock shifts **AS leftward**, raising prices and reducing output across the economy.

# 🔮 Scenario A: Technological Change + Energy Price Shock

India accelerates its digital transition through:

- AI-based healthcare innovation  
- India Stack expansion  
- Remote health delivery  
- Automation in supply chains  
- Digital public infrastructure  
- Cloud and data-driven medicine  

### **Macroeconomic Dynamics**
- Short-run AS shifts left (energy shock)  
- Medium-run AS shifts right (tech-enabled efficiency)  
- LRAS shifts right due to digital productivity  
- AD rises due to lowered transaction costs  

### **Implications for Pfizer**
Opportunities:
- AI-enabled drug discovery  
- Digital therapeutics  
- Remote care and patient engagement  
- Smart supply chain adoption  
- Partnerships with health-tech firms  

Risks:
- Increased competition from digital-native entrants  
- Tighter data localisation and AI governance rules

# 🌍 Scenario B: Climate Change + Energy Price Shock

India experiences compounding climate disruptions:

- Heatwaves  
- Floods and unpredictable rainfall  
- Declining agricultural productivity  
- Rising pollution and disease burden  

### **Macroeconomic Dynamics**
- AS shifts left persistently due to productivity loss  
- AD shifts left due to falling incomes and consumption  
- LRAS shifts left (long-term damage to productive capacity)  
- Sustained stagflation and high public spending pressures  

### **Implications for Pfizer**
Opportunities:
- Climate-adaptive pharmaceuticals  
- Temperature-stable formulations  
- Public-health partnerships  
- Disaster-response medical supply chains  

Risks:
- Supply chain disruption  
- Higher regulatory scrutiny on environmental compliance  
- Rising production and distribution costs

# 🧭 PESTEL Analysis (Pfizer India)

### **Political**
- Scenario A: digital health incentives  
- Scenario B: climate resilience and ESG compliance  
- Both: increased regulatory complexity  

### **Economic**
- Scenario A: moderate recovery  
- Scenario B: fragile growth, inflation spikes  

### **Socio-cultural**
- Scenario A: high digital literacy and telehealth adoption  
- Scenario B: widening health inequities  

### **Technological**
- Scenario A: AI, blockchain, IoT accelerate innovation  
- Scenario B: slower investment except in climate-adaptive tech  

### **Environmental**
- Scenario A: low background risk  
- Scenario B: direct operational disruption  

### **Legal**
- Scenario A: data privacy, AI ethics  
- Scenario B: environmental and occupational regulation

# 🏭 Porter’s Five Forces: Summary

| Force | Scenario A | Scenario B |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **New Entrants** | Higher (digital health startups) | Lower (capital intensity + climate risk) |
| **Substitutes** | High (digital therapeutics) | High (government and low-cost generics) |
| **Supplier Power** | Moderate | High (climate disruption) |
| **Buyer Power** | High (digital transparency) | High (affordability pressure) |
| **Rivalry** | High (innovation race) | Moderate (market consolidation) |

# 🎯 Strategic Implications for Pfizer India

### **In Scenario A (Tech + Energy Shock):**
Pfizer must:
- Invest in digital R&D  
- Build AI-enabled supply chains  
- Form collaborations with Indian health-tech firms  
- Prepare for data governance compliance  

### **In Scenario B (Climate + Energy Shock):**
Pfizer must:
- Build climate-resilient operations  
- Diversify geographically  
- Strengthen ESG reporting and governance  
- Develop climate-adaptive product portfolios  

### **Capabilities Needed Across Both**
- Dynamic capabilities  
- Predictive analytics  
- Real-time market monitoring  
- Flexible regulatory navigation  
- Agile workforce deployment
