## 📌 Project Overview
This report presents a complete strategic redesign for Superdry plc, responding to declining brand relevance, digital underperformance, and shifting consumer expectations. It integrates internal and external analysis with a context-aware strategy to reposition Superdry as a design-led, sustainability-focused, digitally modern lifestyle brand.

The strategic design includes full diagnosis, blended strategy development, Balanced Scorecard KPIs, and a practical implementation roadmap suitable for a BANI (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible) business environment.

## 🎯 Problem Context
Superdry faces multiple structural problems:
- Declining relevance among Gen Z  
- Weak digital capabilities and slow omnichannel execution  
- Margin pressure from wholesale channel dependence  
- Shift towards circular fashion, sustainability, and second-hand markets  
- Volatile macroeconomic conditions (inflation, slow demand, Brexit friction)

The goal was to create a **contextually grounded, actionable, and inclusive strategic plan** that reconnects the brand purpose with operational execution.
