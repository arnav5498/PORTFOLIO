# Business System Evolution (BSE) – Enterprise Data Migration & Digital Transformation Programme

**Organisation:** TransUnion CIBIL (India)  
**Role:** Associate QA Engineer → QA Engineer  
**Project Type:** Large-Scale Digital Transformation | Data Migration | API Modernisation | Quality Engineering  
**Duration:** 2020 – 2024  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Business System Evolution (BSE)** programme was one of TransUnion CIBIL’s largest multi-year transformation projects, aimed at modernising India’s national credit bureau infrastructure.  
The initiative involved replacing legacy bureau processing systems with a modern, scalable, API-first architecture supporting:

- **Consumer Bureau**
- **Mortgage Bureau**
- **MSME / Commercial Bureau**

The work required deep validation of data pipelines, ETL workflows, APIs, UI modules, and the migration of millions of records without loss or degradation.

As a QA Engineer, I was responsible for **ensuring correctness, stability, and regulatory compliance** through rigorous testing, data validation, and collaborative Agile delivery.
