## 📌 Project Overview
This project outlines the end-to-end plan for transforming **PineEase™**, a smart pineapple preparation tool, from prototype to market-ready product within a strict **24-week timeline** and a **$400,000 budget**.  
The project applies a real-world, evidence-based project management approach, integrating Agile–Hybrid delivery with stakeholder governance, risk responsiveness, and strategic decision-making.

The final deliverable is a complete project plan aligned with **PMBOK®, Agile, and industry standards**, designed to support a successful product launch on **1 December 2025**, targeting the seasonal Christmas demand.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Deliver a certified, market-ready single-SKU kitchen device  
- Ensure production of **5,000 units** by early October  
- Maintain a strict **budget cap of $400,000**  
- Achieve **≥85% user satisfaction** from beta testing  
- Launch with a fully executed marketing and PR campaign  

These objectives are structured using **SMART** criteria and linked directly to Gantt activities and milestone sequencing.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology Selection – Agile–Hybrid
The project adopts an **Agile–Hybrid** method because:

- Innovation and user feedback require iteration  
- Investor expectations require documentation and deadlines  
- Time pressure demands both structure and flexibility  
- Product design and marketing must operate in parallel  

A comparative evaluation of **Agile, Waterfall, PRINCE2, and Hybrid** methods was conducted using a decision matrix, with Hybrid achieving the highest suitability score.

## 👥 Stakeholder Strategy
A structured engagement strategy was designed using:

- **Power–Interest Matrix**  
- **Communication Plan**  
- **Haughey’s 4-pillar engagement model**  
  (Communicate, Influence, Reassure, Mobilise)

Key stakeholders include:  
Investors, Founder (you), Core Team, Manufacturers, Marketing Agency, Retailers, Customers, and Regulatory Bodies.

Weekly stand-ups, fortnightly vendor syncs, monthly investor reviews, and milestone-based reporting ensure alignment throughout the 24-week execution cycle.

---

## 📦 Scope Definition
The project scope was defined using **In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope** logic:

### **In-Scope**
- Final product design  
- Beta testing  
- Supplier and vendor contracts  
- Branding, packaging, and promotional content  
- Limited retailer negotiations  
- UK-specific safety certification  
- Launch event  

### **Out-of-Scope**
- International certification (CE/FDA)  
- Multiple SKU variants  
- Full e-commerce system  
- Post-launch feature updates  

This prevents scope creep and aligns with stakeholder expectations.

## 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A **deliverable-oriented WBS** was used following the **100% Rule**, aligning with both PMBOK® and Norman (2005).  
Deliverables include:

1. Product Design  
2. Prototyping & Testing  
3. Manufacturing Setup  
4. Branding & Packaging  
5. Marketing & Launch  
6. Distribution Planning  
7. Project Management & Governance  

The WBS forms the backbone for scheduling, cost estimation, and risk control.

---

## 🗓️ Gantt Chart & Timeline
The schedule includes **14 major tasks**, structured with:

- Critical Path Method (CPM)  
- Parallel tasking (QA, production prep, packaging)  
- Buffer zones before high-risk transitions  
- Non-negotiable launch milestone (1 Dec 2025)  

Dependencies map directly to WBS packages, ensuring planning discipline and delivery feasibility.

## ⚠️ Risk Management
15 risks were identified using **Likelihood × Impact scoring**.  
Top 5 include:

1. Prototype fails QA  
2. Supplier delays  
3. Scope creep  
4. Budget overruns  
5. Team capacity constraints  

Each risk includes **preventive** and **contingency** actions, with clear ownership.  
Risk strategy is aligned with **Lukas (2012)** and **PMBOK® 2021** guidelines.

---

## 🚨 Competitor Shock Scenario
A rival product is expected to launch on **15 November 2025**, two weeks earlier.

A strategic evaluation of four options was conducted:

1. Accelerated launch  
2. Beta user campaign  
3. Brand differentiation (recommended)  
4. Retail partnership push  

Using a weighted decision matrix, **Brand Differentiation** scored highest (4.1/5) and supports long-term positioning while maintaining the original launch date.
