## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **value-driven analytics** to evaluate health intervention priorities for **Strategic Aid for Health (SAFH)**, a global health organisation allocating funding across multiple countries and diseases.

Two major analytical components were developed:

### **1️⃣ Group Assignment – MCDA Model for SAFH**
Built a fully structured **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis** comparing five global health interventions:
- Maternal & Neonatal Disorders (Ethiopia)  
- Maternal & Neonatal Disorders (South Sudan)  
- HIV/AIDS (Kenya)  
- Malaria (Malawi)  
- Non-Communicable Diseases (Zambia)

Six weighted criteria were used:
- Population size  
- DALYs  
- Current Health Expenditure (CHE)  
- Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPS)  
- External Health Expenditure (EXT)  
- Disease-specific expenditure  

### **2️⃣ Individual Assignment – Decision Tree Model for WHO**
Developed a two-year, uncertainty-driven funding path for **WHO** (selected stakeholder).  
Model included:
- Probability-adjusted DALYs  
- Probability-adjusted population impact  
- Sequential funding optimisation  
- Scenario evaluation  
- Criteria variability (±5% uncertainty)  

Both assignments demonstrate advanced analytical modelling, health economic reasoning, and scenario-driven decision making.

# 🧩 Group MCDA Model – Summary

### **Problem**
SAFH must allocate funding across five countries with diverse:
- Disease burdens  
- Population scales  
- Financial constraints  
- System readiness  

### **Approach**
1. Defined criteria using the CAUSE/SUECA framework  
2. Built a **value tree** to structure decision drivers  
3. Normalised all data (0–100 scale)  
4. Assigned weights reflecting SAFH priorities  
5. Calculated weighted scores  
6. Conducted **three sensitivity analyses**

### **Key MCDA Results**
| Rank | Intervention | Weighted Score | Result |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **1** | Ethiopia – Maternal & Neonatal | **77.92** | Highest impact & alignment |
| **2** | Kenya – HIV/AIDS | **55.46** | Strong second option |
| **3** | Zambia – NCDs | 29.89 | Emerging but low scale |
| **4** | Malawi – Malaria | 23.48 | Limited population impact |
| **5** | South Sudan – M&N | 16.29 | Weak system readiness |

### **Why Ethiopia ranked #1**
- Maximum DALYs  
- Largest population impact  
- Highest OOPS → strong equity need  
- High disease burden alignment  

### **Why Kenya ranked #2**
- Strong CHE  
- High disease-specific funding  
- High scalability  

### **Sensitivity Analysis**
Across all variations:
- Ethiopia remained **rank 1**  
- Kenya remained **rank 2**  
- Lower-ranked countries moved slightly but not significantly  

Result: **The MCDA is extremely robust.**

# 🌍 Individual Assignment – WHO Decision Tree Model

## 🎯 Stakeholder: **World Health Organization (WHO)**

Priorities:
- Reduce DALYs  
- Maximise population-level impact  
- Promote equity by reducing OOPS  
- Ensure scalable health outcomes  

## 🌲 Decision Tree Structure

Evaluated Year-1 and Year-2 funding paths under uncertainty:

- DALYs variability: ±5%  
- Population variability: ±5%  
- Probability distributions per country (Kenya, Ethiopia, Zambia)  

### **Key Insights**
- **Ethiopia → Kenya** (Year 1 → Year 2) is the strongest path  
  - Cumulative value: **131.12**
- **Kenya → Ethiopia** generates the highest total value (131.97)  
  - But weaker starting score → Ethiopia remains best first choice  
- Zambia consistently remains lower-value  

**Conclusion:**  
➡ Ethiopia is the optimal Year-1 investment for WHO  
➡ Kenya is optimal for Year-2 follow-up funding

# 📈 Key Recommendations

### **For SAFH**
- Prioritise maternal & neonatal interventions in **Ethiopia**  
- Scale HIV/AIDS solutions in **Kenya**  
- Explore targeted NCD interventions in **Zambia**  
- Maintain donor-supported, limited footprint in Malawi  
- Reassess feasibility in South Sudan  

### **For WHO**
- Invest Year-1 in Ethiopia (highest starting value)  
- Move to Kenya in Year-2 to maximise cumulative impact  
- Build real-time analytics dashboards for DALY/OOPS monitoring  
- Expand uncertainty modelling across all criteria
