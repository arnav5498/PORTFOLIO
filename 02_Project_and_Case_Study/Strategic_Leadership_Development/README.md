## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a reflective leadership portfolio built using **Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle**, analysing three transformative leadership experiences from my MBA journey and professional career.  
It captures how my leadership identity evolved from reactive contributor to reflective, systems-aware, ethically grounded leader.

The three situations span team ambiguity, real-world consulting challenges, and a reframed organisational experience from my time at TransUnion.

# 🧩 Situation 1 — Strategic Leadership Development Challenge  
### **Theme:** Team Leadership, Conflict Navigation, Emotional Intelligence

In a seven-member group working on a live boardroom challenge, I began in a contributor role but organically stepped into a facilitative leadership position:

- Mediated conflict between dominant and disengaged members  
- Structured team discussions and clarified tasks under pressure  
- Managed emotional tension through active regulation  
- Challenged assumptions as a “devil’s advocate” to strengthen strategic thinking  

**Key Learning:**  
Leadership is not positional — influence, emotional regulation, and clarity can stabilise a team in ambiguity.

**Frameworks applied:**  
- Kolb’s learning cycle  
- Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence (self-regulation, social skill)  
- Northouse’s leadership balance (task vs. relationship)  
- Adaptive Leadership (Heifetz et al.)  
- Ethical leadership dilemmas (Levine)

# 🧩 Situation 2 — Consulting Impact Challenge (Walker Precision Engineering)  
### **Theme:** Stakeholder Influence, Systems Leadership, Ethical Decision-Making

During the live consulting project for WPE:

- Mediated a strategic conflict within the team  
- Held the group together during a tense client challenge  
- Balanced perfectionism vs. practicality in the team  
- Reframed team disagreements to restore direction  

**Key Learning:**  
Leadership requires **clarity, moral courage, and systems thinking** — not just harmony.

**Frameworks applied:**  
- Kotter’s alignment principles  
- Goleman’s EQ  
- Systems thinking (Senge)  
- Ethical leadership (Brown & Treviño)  
- Conflict modes (Thomas–Kilmann)

# 🧩 Situation 3 — Leading a Sustainable Organisation (TransUnion Experience)  
### **Theme:** Ethical Leadership, Participatory Change, Systems Thinking

Reframed a past experience at TransUnion where automation was enforced without dialogue.  
Through the LSO module, I recognised:

- Colleagues’ “resistance” was actually **pragmatic feedback**  
- The rollout lacked psychological safety and participatory design  
- I had practiced **ethical passivity** by not questioning the top-down approach  

**Key Learning:**  
Sustainable leadership prioritises **voice before velocity**, shared decision-making, and dignity-preserving change.

**Frameworks applied:**  
- Common Good HRM (Aust et al.)  
- Pragmatic resistance (Clarke)  
- Systems thinking (Senge)  
- Ethical leadership (Levine)  
- Decent Work (ILO)
